  <h2>Echoes of Myth</h2>
  <p>
    A top-down action roguelite built around deliberate, skill-based combat with a Souls-like edge. Master telegraphed enemies,
    manage scarce healing, and forge powerful builds as you fight your way through a fractured world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The world has fractured into a chaos of drifting realms. The gods have fallen silent, their power left behind you to harness.
    You are an unbound child of the divine, a spirit possessing mortal vessels in a desperate, cyclical journey toward the world’s core.
  </p>
  <p>
    Death is not the end. It is a necessary retreat. Early attempts can be punishing, but each failure brings you back stronger,
    revealing new truths, new powers, and a path closer to restoring this broken reality.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Deliberate Souls-lite Combat</h2>
  <p>
    The fight for survival demands mastering your weapon, spells, or a mix of both in deliberate, skill-based Souls-lite combat.
    Enemy attacks are clearly telegraphed, but your approach is defined by the tools and build you select: do you rely on positioning,
    dodges and parries, control foes with stagger and status effects, or maintain distance with spell-heavy precision?
  </p>
  <p>
    Every encounter is designed around clarity and avoidable damage. Health and healing are scarce, ensuring that the better you master
    your current build's specific strengths, the further you will push into the shattered realms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed to be challenging but fair, the game rewards persistence: early attempts may be punishing, but growing mastery and
    permanent upgrades gradually shift the balance in your favor.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Buildcraft</h2>
  <p>
    Discover powerful synergies and make run-defining choices to craft your character's build. While combat mastery is core,
    smart build decisions can dramatically amplify your strengths or compensate for weaknesses.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weapon and Spells:</strong> Choose your weapon and spells for the run from randomized options with different playstyles and strengths</li>
    <li><strong>Talents:</strong> Select from randomized talents on level-ups, ranging from Common to Epic, with rare Legendary powers unlocked through endgame Realm Distortions</li>
    <li><strong>Divine Relics:</strong> Find powerful artifacts left behind by vanished gods, shaping your build’s direction with major power boosts</li>
    <li><strong>Infusions:</strong> Modify abilities into specialized tools, such as mana engines or critical-strike triggers</li>
    <li><strong>Forks of Fate:</strong> Twice per run, choose between impactful tradeoffs—raw power, calculated risk, or balance</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Lasting Progress</h2>
  <p>
    Every attempt leaves something behind. Titan essence collected during a run can be invested in the Sanctuary to unlock permanent upgrades,
    steadily increasing survivability and power. Each failure becomes a step toward eventual victory.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Exploring a Broken World</h2>
  <p>
    Plan your route across a semi-randomized world map where each node presents distinct rewards, risks, and opportunities to shape your run.
    Choose between relic hunts, combat trials, upgrades, or permanent currency as you push deeper toward the core.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, encounter the world’s surviving denizens and uncover more about the forces that shaped this fractured reality.
    Each run makes you stronger, more capable, and better prepared for what lies ahead.
  </p>
