  <h2>Echoes of Myth</h2>
  <p>
    The world has fractured into a chaos of drifting realms. The gods have fallen silent, their power left behind you to harness.
    You are an unbound child of the divine, a spirit possessing mortal vessels in a desperate, cyclical journey toward the world’s core.
  </p>
  <p>
    Death is not the end in this roguelite made by a solo indie developer. It is a necessary retreat.
    You will die often, but each failure brings you back stronger, revealing new truths, new powers, and a path closer to restoring this broken reality.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Deliberate Souls-lite Combat</h2>
  <p>
    The fight for survival demands mastering your weapon, spells or a mix in deliberate Souls-lite combat.
    Enemy attacks are clearly telegraphed, but your approach is defined by the tools and build you select: do you rely on positioning and dodges,
    control foes with stagger and status effects, or maintain distance with spell-heavy precision?
    Health and healing are scarce, ensuring that the better you master your current build's specific strengths, the further you will push into the shattered realms.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Buildcraft</h2>
  <p>Discover powerful synergies and make run-defining choices to craft your character's build.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weapon and Spells:</strong> Choose your weapon and spells for the run from randomized options with different playstyles and strengths each</li>
    <li><strong>Divine Relics:</strong> Find powerful artifacts the vanished gods left behind, immediately providing a major power boost and shaping your build's direction (e.g., elemental mastery or defensive fortitude).</li>
    <li><strong>Infusions:</strong> Transform your abilities with these modifications, allowing you to spec spells into specialized tools, like a mana-restoring engine or a critical-strike trigger.</li>
    <li><strong>Forks of Fate:</strong> Twice in a run, you must choose between significant run-long tradeoffs. Do you go for maximum power, select the vulnerability your build can best endure or go for the best of both worlds?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Lasting Progress</h2>
  <p>
    Every attempt leaves something behind for you to build on. Titan essence collected during a run can be invested in the Sanctuary to unlock permanent upgrades,
    transforming every death into a step toward victory, ensuring that while your power increases, there are always fresh trials available to test your growing skill.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="features">
  <h2>Exploring a Broken World</h2>
  <p>
    Navigate through fragmented zones where each route presents a clear reward. Weigh risks and opportunities, create your own path.
    Along the way you encounter the world’s surviving denizens from whom you can learn more about the world’s state and the forces that shaped it.
  </p>
  <p>Each run helps you grow stronger, more capable and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
